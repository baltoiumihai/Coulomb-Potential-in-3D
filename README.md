# Coulomb Potential in 3D: Numerical Evaluation of Energies and Wavefunctions

This project calculates and visualizes the energies and wavefunctions of a particle in a Coulomb potential in 3D space. It utilizes numerical methods to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation in 3D and provides visualizations to help understand the quantum states of the particle.


## Features

- Calculation of the energies and wavefunctions using finite difference methods.
- Visualization of 2D slices and 3D isosurfaces of the wavefunctions.
- Numerical methods such as Power Iteration, Inverse Power Iteration, and Shifted Inverse Power Iteration to find the dominant eigenstates.
